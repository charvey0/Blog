# Project Description

This app is a blog.  A new user can register for a user account by providing their username, email and a password.  The password is hashed using bcrypt before it is stored in the database.  After the user is logged in, they will be able to access a dashboard that shows all their posts with the options to comment, edit or delete them.  When clicking on the "Home" menu item, the user will see all the posts on the blog and be able to comment on other users posts and edit or delete their own comments.
